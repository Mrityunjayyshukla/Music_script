## Overview

Music Script is a script created using **python**üêç to search and download songs in your local deviceüíª. It uses **Spotify and YouTube API** to fetch the song information and change metadata.<br>
For the processing of the audio files, the program uses **FFmpeg**. So FFmpeg has to be installed to use the program

## Features

* Provides a user interface created using streamlit for user experience.
* For Command Line Users, the program also provides command line based working
* User can search for the songs and can get the information of that song
* Audio files contains the song information saved in the audio's metadata

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Python**: To create the script
- **FFmpeg**: To save the audio and audio postprocessing to prevent corrupt audio files
- **Streamlit**: To create the User Interface (UI) of the program
- **Spotify API**: To search and get song information
- **YouTube API**: To search the song on YouTube and return video link of the song

## Installation
### Steps to install FFmpeg
- **Download FFmpeg**
  
Visit the official FFmpeg website: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html<br>
- **Choose the Windows build:**

`Windows -> Windows builds by BtbN`<br>
Download the "ffmpeg-release" zip file, typically labeled as ffmpeg-release-i686 or ffmpeg-release-x86_64, depending on whether you're using 32-bit or 64-bit Windows<br>
- **Extract FFmpeg**<br>

After downloading the zip file, right-click on it and select Extract All.<br>
Choose a location where you'd like to extract the files, such as C:\ffmpeg\ or C:\Program Files\ffmpeg\.<br>
Inside the extracted folder, you should see a folder named bin. This folder contains the executable files for FFmpeg (ffmpeg.exe, ffprop.exe, etc.).<br>
- **Add FFmpeg to System Path**
  
To run FFmpeg from any command prompt window without navigating to the folder each time, you'll need to add its location to the system PATH.<br>
Open the folder where you extracted FFmpeg, and inside the bin directory, copy the path to the bin folder (e.g., C:\ffmpeg\bin).<br>
Right-click on the Start button and select System.<br>
`System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables -> Path (edit)`<br>
In the Edit Environment Variable window, click New, then paste the path you copied earlier (C:\ffmpeg\bin).<br>
Click OK to close all the windows.<br>
- **Verify FFmpeg Installation**<br>

Check FFmpeg version:<br>
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```
in the command prompt
If FFmpeg was installed correctly, you should see details about the version of FFmpeg you installed.<br>
